<div>
Hi, This is Felix aka lazysquirtle. I'm a firmware/software engineer from Taiwan. I'm fascinated by coding, ARM microcontroller dev, operating systems as well as custom firmwares. Most of the projects I developed are available for everyone to use, and some of the them were the homework from the courses I attended in my college. 

Besides programming, I love drawing, playing the guitar and basketball.
